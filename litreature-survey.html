            Machine learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence that has been gaining a lot of prominence in the current era. It is
            specifically to do with building systems that are able to learn by themselves without having to be programmed.
            Deep learning is a subset of techniques of machine learning. Deep learning allows multiple processing layers
            to breakdown the given data into smaller parts and learn the representations of these data. Deep learning
            is the state of the art in areas such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, visual object recognition,
            etc. Convolutional neural networks have brought many breakthroughs in areas such as processing images, pictures
            and speech, whereas Recurrent networks have been extremely successful in areas such as processing text and speech.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Lessons from History</h2>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            QA is a well researched area from the point of NLP (Natural Language Processing) research. QA has mostly been used to develop
            intricate dialogue systems such as chat-bots and other systems that mimic human interaction. Traditionally
            most of these systems use the tried methods of parsing, part-of-speech tagging, etc that come from the domain
            of NLP research. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with these techniques, they do have their limitations.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            W.A. Woods et al. shows how we can use NLP as a front end for extracting information from a given query and then translate
            that into a logical query which can then then be converted into a database query language that can be passed
            into the underlying database management system. In addition to that there needs to be a lexicon that functions
            as an admissible vocabulary of the knowledge base so that it is possible to filter out unnecessary terminology.
            The knowledge base is processed to an ontology that breaks it down into classes, relations and functions.
            Natural Language Database Interfaces (NLDBIS) are database systems that allow users to access stored data using
            natural language requests. Some popular commercial systems are IBM’s LanguageAccess and Q&A from Symantec.

          <span class="caption text-muted">QA is an old research domain that has attracted a lot of attention recently</span>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Information retrieval (IR) is another technique that has been used to address the problem of QA. With IR systems pay attention
            to the organisation, representation and storage of information artifacts such that when a user makes a query
            the system is able to to return a document or a collection of artifacts that relate to the query. Recent
            advances in OCR and other text scanning techniques have meant that it is possible to retrieve passages of text
            rather than entire documents. However IR is still widely seen as from the document retrieval domain rather than
            from the QA domain.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">Template based question answering is another technique that has been used for QA</blockquote>


          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Template based question answering is another technique that has been used for QA and is currently being used by the START
            system which has answered over a million questions since 1993. START uses natural language annotations to
            match questions to candidate answers. An annotation will have the structure of ‘subject-relationship-object’
            and when a user asks a question, the question will be matched to all the available annotation entries at the
            word level (using synonyms, IS-A, etc) and the structure level. When a successful match is found, the annotation
            will point to an information segment which will be returned as the answer.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            When new information resources are incorporated into the SMART system, the natural language annotations have to be composed
            manually. START uses Omnibase as the underlying database system to store information and when the annotation
            match is found, the database query must be used to retrieve the information. While this system has been relatively
            successful, it requires a lot of preprocessing which must be done manually.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Our Approach</h2>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Our literature survey has found that the QA domain has an active community of researchers and many different approaches have
            been tried to tackle this problem. While the problem of QA is a very old one, the origins of the problem can
            be traced back as far as the 1960’s, using our access to cheaper and better computational power and newer techniques
            in data processing we believe we can attempt to solve this issue using a different set of tactics. This will
            be explained in the next section, the research gap.
