          <p style="text-align: justify">
            As explained in the introduction, there is a wealth of information on the internet. For any given domain we are able to find
            a huge amount of information. However to use this information effectively, there needs to be a system to process
            the data and extract out the meaningful information. Further it is important to provide a simple and seamless
            way of interacting with this data. This has given rise to the field to natural language question answering where
            a user must be able to ask a question in everyday language and receive a factually correct answer quickly. In
            the literature survey we discussed three different techniques that have been used to tackle this problem, NLP,
            Information Retrieval and Template based question answering. All three methods have flaws where either the accuracy
            is not high enough or it may take a lot of manual processing and so on. This has meant that while this is an
            important problem domain due to the high costs there haven’t been any commercially viable solutions yet.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The solution that we are proposing for this problem domain is one that is based on deep learning. Deep learning can be defined
            a subset of machine learning techniques that uses non-linear information processing to identify and extract features
            and patterns in data, classification and transformations. There are three key reasons that deep learning has
            become so popular in the recent past. First, the hugely increased processing abilities and availability of general
            purpose GPU’s, the vast amount of training data that has become available and the many advances made in the recent
            past in the field of deep learning that has made the task of training artificial neural networks more efficient
           .
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Deep Neural Network</h2>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Deep learning makes extensive use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to complete a given task. ANN’s are inspired from the
            neural networks found in the human brain. The brain consists of an intricate network of neuron cells. Researchers
            have found success in trying to replicate this structure on silicon chip. Each neuron would consist of what is
            known as an activation function and the neurons would be connected to each other via connections called tensors
           . The entire ANN would consist of an input layer of neurons, multiple hidden layers and an output layer.
            Biases are assigned to neurons and weights are assigned to the tensors. These values influence what eventually
            becomes the output of the ANN. When training an ANN we will be adjusting these weights and biases to get the
            desired output for a known input data set and known scenario. When working with a large ANN with several
            tens of neurons it can become a tedious task to adjust the weights and biases manually. There are algorithms
            we can use such as backpropagation to help us adjust these values automatically until we get to the desired output.

          <span class="caption text-muted">Basic representation of an ANN </span>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Since deep neural networks are exemplary at recognising patterns and processing data extremely fast, we believe that by applying
            deep learning techniques to this problem domain we will be able to overcome many of the drawbacks of the other
            approaches. We will be able to have a higher accuracy because of the state of the art neural network training
            paradigms, reduce manual tasks by allowing an ANN to process and structure the corpus and automatically extract
            the required features and we will not need to use an underlying database engine so therefore we will not need
            to adopt or develop a different query language.
